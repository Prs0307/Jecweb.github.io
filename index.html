        <h6>

Jabalpur Engineering College in its 74 years of glorious existence has carved a unique niche for itself in the annals of technical education in M.P. The college since its inception has a well equipped High Voltage Laboratory and several other well advanced Laboratories.

Since then the college has achieved several mile stones living up to its motto ‘on wards on wings’ .Very recently the institution has proved its mettle by becoming a Lead Institution under Technical Education Quality improvement program (TEQIP) .We have added one more feather in our cap by achieving Academic Autonomy .

I am confident that the graduating engineers will strive to build India a nation which will be “proud of her independence, powerful in her defense, self reliant in industry and technology “

I close my message with a saying from Theodore Roosevelt: “The best prize that life offers is the chance of working hard at work, worth doing."
